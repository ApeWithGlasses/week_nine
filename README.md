# Problem Case

A medical clinic wants to improve the efficiency of its appointment system and the quality of patient care. Currently, the clinic has problems with missed appointments, long waiting times, and difficulty tracking patient medical history.

The clinic has a database that contains information on patient appointments, including the date and time of the appointment, the physician who kept the appointment, whether or not the patient attended the appointment, and any diagnosis or treatment provided during the appointment. They also have a separate database with demographic information about patients, such as age, gender, and any pre-existing medical conditions.

Using pandas, the clinic could combine and analyze this data to obtain valuable information that could help solve their problems. For example, they could:
- Identify the most and least popular appointment times to optimize appointment scheduling.
- Identify patients who most often miss appointments to implement more effective appointment - reminders.
- Analyze wait times based on physician, time of day, and day of week to identify and address any inefficiencies.
- Track patient medical history to provide more personalized and effective care.
